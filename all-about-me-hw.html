		<h1>Where I'm from?</h1>
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
			<p>I was born and raised in London, Ontario for most of my life. Right before highschool my family and I moved to the country out by Lucan.</p>
		<h1>Where did I go to school?</h1>
			<p>I was in french as a first language for elementry school (even though its my second) and continued with that throughout middle school,and did a switch to immersion for highschool. Because I live so far out in the country I had to go to banting because it is the closest school that will bus for french.</p>
		<h1>My intesrests?</h1>
		<p>My main interest is art, I'm always looking for new ways to be and add creativity to my life. My second interest would have to be all things television and film. I love the culture and techniques behind it. I was a big movie kid and can proudly say that it is an interest that has trailed into adulthood with me. I am also very interested in all things fantasy, which stemed from my love of film. Fairies, witches, goblins, and all...</p>
		<h1>How did I end up in this program?</h1>
			<p>In grade 11 I was in a media development course and my teacher was just so amazing and cool, and talked about everything I felt interested in doing for post secondary. In finding interest in media, I decided to move forth to the design foundations program as I was still not sure what kind of media/development I wanted to do. In doing that program, all the computer classes I had turned out to be what I liked most, thus bringing me to this program.</p>
